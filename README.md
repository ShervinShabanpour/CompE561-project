# CompE561-project (BLK-Market)
# Disclaimer: We are making a joke website that is a fake black-market equivalent of Amazon/eBay

# BLK-Market will be a site designed to hide the user purchase history through the exchange of the currency into a digital cash system that will have no tracks. A person 
# would want to interact with our website if they wish to purchase an item without having their card numbers and cash linked to the purchase. Information will not be stored for 
# long periods of time.

# for example, when making a purchase you would use the BLKMarket’s currency and will only have 1 chance to set the delivery address since we will delete said data from the      # database after confirming the purchase. (We will include a warning message saying, “Do NOT enter your personal address or home address!!”.) We are thinking of having a system 
# that will store the address for only 6 hours before deletion occurs.
